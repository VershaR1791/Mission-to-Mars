# Mission-to-Mars
The project undertaken by Robin was to create a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Scraping data from website
- **Mars News**: Collect the news title and description of the latest news.
- **Featured Image**: Find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image.
- **Mars Weather**: Scrape the latest Mars weather from the page.
- **Mars Facts**: Scrape the table containing facts about the planet.
- **Mars Hemispheres**: Obtain URLs of high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

## MongoDB and Flask Application
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
